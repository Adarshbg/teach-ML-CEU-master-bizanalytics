## Lab wk01

### Goals

After this first lab every student should have installed and working on their laptops:

- R
- RStudio
- some R packages TBD
- Java (needed for h2o)
- h2o (from R, run [this](h2o-test-installation.R) to test if it is working)

should have 

- a github account
- an AWS account with $100 worth of free student credits

should be able to 

- create a simple Rmarkdown file, run it in RStudio and get html report
- upload files to their github account
- start an EC2 instance, create an image, stop/restart, configure security groups (open ports)
- use `ssh` and basic Unix/Linux command line
- do same work in RStudio server on EC2 and in RStudio locally on laptop

On EC2 one can use this [AMI](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/) with R and RStudio server already
installed. Please change the default password for the `rstudio` user (e.g. as described 
at the previous link).

Warning: The Rstudio connection (from your browser) does not use SSL, therefore don't use this server
on projects requiring security (e.g. with confidential data) or set up SSL connection (https) *before*
you connect to RStudio for the very first time.

#### Java and h2o

Install Java (required by h2o) via command line (e.g. by logging in via ssh): 
```
sudo apt-get install default-jre
```
(then you can install h2o as an R package from RStudio).

#### lightgbm

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Microsoft/LightGBM", subdir = "R-package")
```
(might need cmake: `sudo apt-get install cmake`)
