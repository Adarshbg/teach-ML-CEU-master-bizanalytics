## Machine Learning #1 and #2


This repo contains materials for the introductory/intermediate Machine Learning (ML) courses (4 credits total) taught in the 
[MSc in Business Analytics program](https://economics.ceu.edu/program/master-science-business-analytics) 
at the Central European University (CEU) starting January 2017. 
The material for the previous 2-credit course taught in 2015 and 2016 can be found 
[here](https://github.com/szilard/teach-data-science-msc-analytics-ceu).


### Course Description and Objectives

The breakdown below (into ML #1 an #2) is somewhat adhoc and mainly to comply with administrative requirements.
Both courses will intertwine general ML concepts, algorithms and software implementations/tools and will
aim to strike a balance of theory and practice with the goal of equiping students with both the
foundations to understand the ML methodology and also with the skills needed for using ML in practical
business applications.

#### Data Science and Machine Learning 1 (Concepts):

After an overview of the entire data science landscape this course will focus on machine learning. The course will introduce the main fundamental concepts in machine learning (supervised learning, training, scoring, accuracy measures, test set, overfitting, cross validation, model capacity, hyperparameter tuning, grid and random search, regularization, ensembles, model selection etc.) The concepts will be illustrated with R code therefore it requires prior familiarity with R.

#### Data Science and Machine Learning 2 (Tools):

This course will build on the previous one (which introduced the basic concepts in machine learning) and will discuss state-of-the-art algorithms for supervised learning (linear models, lasso, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, neural networks, support vector machine, deep learning etc.). A large part of the course will be dedicated to using (hands-on) the software tools for machine learning used by data scientists in practice (various high-performance R packages, h2o, xgboost, libraries for deep learning on GPUs etc.).
